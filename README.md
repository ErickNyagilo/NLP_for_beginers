# Natutral Language for Beginners

Lemmatization is a process by which inflected forms of words are grouped together to be analyzed as a single aspect. 
It is a way of using the intended meaning of a word to determine the “lemma”. It is largely depending on correctly 
finding “intended parts of speech” and the true meaning of a word in a sentence, paragraph, or larger documents. 
Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” 
and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.
